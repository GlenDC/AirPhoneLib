AirPhone
==========

AirPhone is a lightweight library written in [Go](http://golang.org/), to allow you as a mobile game developer to develop games faster. Imagine the speed of compiling and running your game on your computer, combined with the power of the input of any mobile device. Thanks to Airphone, you'll be able to enjoy this and boost up your development cycle, free or charge and as easy as a wireless connection can be. That's right, no wires.

_Note to myself:_ Make pitch more clear to prevent confusion and wrong first impressions from users.

_Disclaimer:_ AirPhone is not an all-around solution. You'll still have to do tests on the mobile device itself, for tests such as mobile render tests. However if you're sure that your engine does all of this correctly, and it supports your computer platform in the same way as it supports your target mobile platform, you can minimize the amount of "push" tests drasticly.

  * Support for [Go](http://golang.org/), C, C++, C# and a couple of more languages
  * Connect any mobile device to your game via your favorite html5 browser
  * Capture all the different touch and button events as if your game was running on a mobile device
  * Get all this hot data wireless and ready to use in your game
  * Implement this lightweight library within a mather of minutes in your game (engine).

## Examples

_The library is still in development, please come back later. Soon I'll have several example and a quick interactive tutorial to help you getting started!_

[AirPad](https://github.com/GlenDC/AirPad) is a product developed by me, using Airphone. It will be used as one of the biggest examples of how AirPhone can also be used in a final product, rather than just for speeding up the development of a mobile game.
